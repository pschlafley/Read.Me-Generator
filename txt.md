  ## Description
  You will be able to generate a template for a readMe.md file for your projects. The application goes through best practices for making a readMe and generates it based on how you answer the questions. This application is a command line app that uses node.js as well as the inquirer npm package to prompt the user for questions.

  All you have to do is follow the steps provided up above. Then you will open up the terminal in the root directory of your project. Once you are in the terminal you will type "node index.js" (without the quotes of course). Then all you have to do is answer each question and the app will generate a ReadMe template for you!
